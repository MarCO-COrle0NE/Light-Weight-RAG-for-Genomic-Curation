{"id": "S1","title":"Identification of Genetic Heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s Disease across Age","text":"APOE ε4 risk is markedly age-dependent: in ADGC data, carrying one ε4 allele raised AD risk ~4.6× in ages 60–79 and ~2.8× in ages ≥80; two ε4 alleles raised risk ~15× vs ~3.6×, respectively. Partitioned heritability also differs by age—chromosome 19 (harboring APOE) explains a substantially larger share in younger cases. These findings indicate ε4 is a stronger risk factor earlier, with attenuated effect in the oldest group, supporting age-related genetic heterogeneity in AD."}
{"id": "S2","title":"Identification of Genetic Heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s Disease across Age","text":"Age-stratified gene-based GWAS found, beyond the APOE region, four significant genes in ages 60–79—BIN1, OR2S2, MS4A4E, and PICALM—and three suggestive genes (CR1, MS4A6A, GNPNAT1). Effects at BIN1, PICALM, OR2S2, and GNPNAT1 were stronger in the younger group, with largely non-overlapping confidence intervals across ages and significant heterogeneity tests, highlighting loci whose impact diminishes in ≥80."}
{"id": "S3","title":"Identification of Genetic Heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s Disease across Age","text":"Genome-wide REML estimates in ADGC yielded ~18–32% SNP heritability (depending on covariates), with a genetic correlation rg≈0.64 between 60–79 and ≥80, indicating divergent genetic components. Chromosome-19-specific partitioning showed ~9–10% contribution in younger vs <1% in older, and APOE ε4 explained ~12–13% of phenotypic variation in younger vs ~4–5% in older—evidence for a more polygenic architecture at older ages beyond APOE."}
{"id": "S4","title":"Genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease in subjects with and without hypertension","text":"Across hypertensive-positive and hypertensive-negative groups in four cohorts, GWAS/TWA/gene-based tests uncovered group-specific SNPs and genes outside 19q13 and enriched pathways: mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, immune responses, cell-cell adhesion/junctional complexes, and platelet homeostasis. BBB-related junctional pathways and oxidative-stress/mitochondrial dysfunction mechanistically link vascular risk to AD pathogenesis, suggesting HTN-modulated genetic heterogeneity."}
{"id": "S5","title":"Genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease in subjects with and without hypertension","text":"Background context: late-onset AD heritability is substantial; APOE ε4 is the strongest common-variant risk, but many additional loci have smaller effects and cluster in lipid metabolism, immune, and endosomal/vesicle-cycling pathways. Outside chromosome 19, replicated AD-associated variants tend to be group-specific by hypertension status, whereas 19q13 (APOE-cluster) signals are more shared, consistent with both shared and context-dependent genetic architecture."}
